Since upgrading to a single GPU (RX 480) trying to game consistently, after sleeping my system and returning later, results in tearing/games crashing and both HWiNFO64 v5.50 and v5.52 report GPU Memory Errors.

First time poster here, I had a question: I've done my homework on modding (I run a successful Skyim install with 250+ mods), so when I bought Fallout New Vegas in the Summer Steam Sale this year, I was expecting great things. So far, I'm not disappointed, it's an amazing experience and I really enjoy the game. I've been beating my head against the desk though after doing what feels like light modding and hoped someone here could help me out. The major issue is that the game "freezes".

I would like to upgrade my PC. Currently it seems to be running hot all the time and so it's making a lot of noise. I especially notice when I'm playing games (Civ 5 or Banished.) I think I have a decent enough base (processor, RAM), but I think my video card might be lacking, and I would be willing to upgrade my fans, or go with water or anything to get the noise down really.

I just beat Portal 1 for the 2nd time the other night, and when I went to launch Portal 2 to continue my binge, it wouldn't start. It loads Steam, signs into my account, launches the game and plays through the Valve intro, and then when it gets to the next screen it hangs, and the "click" sound of the menu loading plays over and over again. I have to use Task Manager (Process explorer, but still) to kill the Portal2 process.

Microsoft Windows 7 Service Pack 1 provides ongoing improvements to the Windows Operating System (OS), by including previous updates delivered over Windows. I needed to off-load some of Windows' bulky default directories from my primary SSD to secondary drives. This included the user directories where Chrome likes to install itself. During the Windows installation, I robocopied the user directories (among other things) over to my E drive (the primary is C) and set up a link (mklink) from C:\users to E:\users. I am able to install Chrome fine, but now it won't let me remain signed in to the browser so I have to sign in each time the browser opens. ¬∑ !–í–ù–ò–ú–ê–ù–ò–ï! –°–∞–π—Ç –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π, –∞ –∑–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –ª–∏—à—å.
