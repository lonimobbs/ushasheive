Hello guys, today i show you how to install ACE for Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead, enjoy. A few years ago I used to play the ACE/ACRE mod for ARMA 2 OA and it had lots of good features. One feature in particular I can see possibly being useful is squad lead dual comms. In the ACE/ACRE mod, whenever a squad lead would use the radio to talk to command, his microphone feed was picking on both command and direct chat. What this does is let people in the squad leader's vicinity hear what he is saying to command. This also helps people realize that they should hold what conversations. Exctract it in your arma folder All mod in arma are a simple folder begining by "@" So you should have these 2 folders in your arma folder : @ACRE. 
Hey all! amp#x200B; I need some help with a decision. (gonna spill my story too because since coming back im a bubbling pot of nostalgia right now) amp#x200B; So i used to play arma (300+ hours in operation flashpoint cold war crisis map editor on my own before i knew what online play was like, arma 1, 2, OA, 3) then dropped it and moved on to DCS and then just stopped really gaming so much. I was chatting to my girlfriend and she said arma sounds boring from the stories Maybe they were just browsing the web on the system and recieved a virus the old fashion way?? I suppose having U.S. drones surfing the internet would explain a lot of youtube commenters behavior. Cerberus Security Corps Welcome to Cerberus Security Corps, this document will describe what to expect in this unit. Our ops range from realism to blasting aliens in a solar system far from ours. We love to have fun and joke around when we are not in the ops but when we are in game mode we keep it real. Now some basic rules: 1. The ops are not mandatory, but if you are not expected to show up very often you will be last on the list for a role or a promotion 2. If you do show up though Welcome to ARMA. APEX is basically an ADDON to ARMA 3. It includes a new map - Tanoa, and a bunch of new gear with a new sub faction - CSAT Pacific, which is an addition to CSAT. New Map New Weapons New Vehicals New Jets I play mostly in SP myself and I recommend you get at LEAST ARMA 3 + APEX. After answering a few questions about installing Lingor Island for DayZ in another thread, I thought I'd make a step-by-step tutorial. NOTE This tutorial is made for DayZ_Lingor v031. The mod has since updated to Dayz_Lingor v032. It should still work as long as you use the mod download from the official site (www.dayzlingor.tk), but I cannot assist with the new version if there are errors. NOTE 2 - THIS TUTORIAL HAS LONG-SINCE BEEN OUT OF DATE. IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH IT, IT'S PROBABLY. ArmA 2, ArmA II,  ArmA ArmA II ArmA OA ArmA 3. ArmA ArmA II ArmA OA ArmA 3.
